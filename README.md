### Who is this Tikitu guy anyway?

As far as things that end up in git go, mostly it's the Swift I write for my day job. Outside of version control I play mandola and take macro photographs of insects. I have a long-untouched [homepage](https://logophile.org) and as of late 2022 I'm on Mastodon as <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@tikitu">@tikitu@mastodon.social</a>.
